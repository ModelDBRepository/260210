hierarchical anti-Hebbian network model for the formation of spatial
cells in three-dimensional space", Nature Communications (2018) 9:4046

<p>This model shows how spatial representations in 3D space could emerge
using unsupervised neural networks. Model is a hierarchical one which
means that it has multiple layers, where each layer has a specific
function to achieve. This architecture is more of a generalised one
i.e. it gives rise to different kinds of spatial representations after
training.
